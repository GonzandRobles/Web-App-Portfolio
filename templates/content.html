              This refers when you break a big problem into smaller problems, it makes easier to understand the big picture. Solving problems is a part of being able to system thinking. The most difficult part of solving problems is to know where to start. The very first thing you have to do is to try to understand the problem. All computer problems have two things in common, they have inputs and desired outputs. Udacity's Pythonist Guide goes like this:

              The While Loops are used to repeat codes. It has a test expression followed by a block, when the expression is true then the block executes, when the expression is false, the the code skips the True block to go to the False one. On the other hand, loops can be infinite if the expression does not correspond to False.

              For loops are easier to use because you need to write less code than the while loops. They are written like this: 
              <br>
                <span class="code">
                for [name] in [list]:

                The Loop goes through each element of the list and evaluates the block. In other words, for loop is used to repeat an action/sentence certain number of times within a range. We can use For Loops on list to, syntax looks like this:

            <i>Templating, and in particular web templating is a way to represent data in different forms. These forms often (but not always) intended to be readable, even attractive, to a human audience. Frequently, templating solutions involve a document (the template) and data. Template usually looks much like the final output, with placeholders instead of actual data (or example data in simplified form), bears common style and visual elements. Data which is presented using that template may be also separated in two parts - data required to be rendered, and data required for template itself (navigation elements if it is a site, button names if it is some UI). Combining template+data produces the final output which is usually (but not always) a web page of some kind."</i>

            <br>
            One important thing about templates is that they help you to avoid repetition by enheriting their data to other files, so you don't have to write the same code over and over again which leads to errors because sometimes you have to change the same variable or string or number in a lot of parts and if you forget to do it in one of them, then you'll have a bug. Another cool thing about templates is that you can keep your html templates in separate files from your main.py document so you have a better readability and understanding of the codes which leads to avoid repetitions and less bugs. Another important thing is that functions and classes can have names that are understandable for humans because you can put names that are totally related with what that function is doing or refering.

           In the perspective of security, Validation helps to prevent user to modify your website, Let's say a bad user tries to put some bold or header html tags in the site to modify the way it looks, that will be terrible because that is just an example of a little thing that can be modified, they can change the complete structure of the site. That's why validating the fieds and autoescaping them it's really important because it limits the user input to only correct, clean data. Validating restrictions are useful when users try to put numbers that are not allowed or strings or even html tags, if the site is validated, those tags are just going to appear as plain text instead of a modifiable item. In simple terms validation makes the site more friendly user because it helps the user to avoid mistakes by letting them know what is expected in each field or when they introduce something wrong by telling them that, "that was an incorrect input".
           <br>
           The purpose of validation is to talk to the user, let them know when they are right also when they are wrong. If you don't include the validation form in the site, the user is going to have to guess where the mistake was and that is not good, users can be impatient and that can create a bad experience with your website; on the other hand, if you have a good form validation, the user is going to know in which field they put incorrect input so they can fix that piece of information, making things faster and friendly. There are websites that highlight the incorrect fields and add bright notification text below like Twitter. There are other ones like mint that validates input instantly as you write in the boxes by addind a check or a cross marks.
           <br>
           There are two different types of validation:
           <br>
           <br>
           <u><span>Server Side Validation</span></u>.- Users submit the form and the contact form script will analyze and bring up an error if the parameters doesn't match that field.
           <br>
           <u><span>Client Side Validation</span></u>.- This is where instant feedback is generated on a field-to-field basis without submission. Javascript it's used here. This one offers a more friendly user support because it tells you right away if you put something good or wrong and you don't have to submit the form to know what is good or wrong. The con of this validation is that if the user has the javascript off, they will not see the validation message.
           <br> 
           <br>
           As a conclusion, the best validations are the ones that anticipate errors that user might make. That's why it is a good idea not to leave the validation forms at the end because once the code is complete, it might be very difficult to adapt it.</p>

            <p class="p-text">
             This method inserts data at the end of the item. There was an exercise where we were inserting name and role inside a resume, we used the prepend method to insert those values. The difference between append and prepend is that prepend its going to add the item in front of another one, for example:
            <br>
            <span class="code">
            var formattedName = HTMLheaderName.replace("%data%", name);
            <br>
            var role = "Web Developer";
            <br>
            var formattedRole = HTMLheaderRole.replace("%data%", role);
            <br>
            $("#header").prepend(formattedRole);
            <br>
            $("#header").prepend(formattedName);
            <br>
          </span>
            With this piece of code, we can see that we replace the value of name and role with the ones in var role and var name; then we prepend those in the header, as we can see the prepend role code is before the prepend name code, the reason we did this its because, like we mention before, prepend puts items "on top" of another one, this means that (formattedName) its going to appear above of (formattedRole) in the HTML because it's in second place, so second place is prepending the first one...

            "jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information about what is actually visible on a website.
            While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
            DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
            its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
            object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
            website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
            the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything

          <p class="p-text">
            Booleans in JS are called Truthy and Falsy. The reason why they are called like that is because in JavaScript, the true values are not just true, it means that the value coerces to True when evaluated in boolean context. On the other hand there are only 6 Falsy values in JS: undefined, null, NaN, 0, "" (empty string), and false. The interesting part of truthy and falsy is that some falsy elements will become truthy if the are wrap inside an object; lets say that in the object you have a {string, number, null, undefined, boolean}, etc... so even when we have Falsy elements inside this object, its value is Truthy because objects in JS are truthy.
            <br>
            The truthy elements are: True, non-zero numbers, strings, objects, arrays and functions. We saw an example with negative numbers in the course and it happens that negative numbers are truthy too since they are not zero. I found a couple of website that exemplify the truthy and falsy values:

            array.pop() it's going to remove the last element of the array.

            array.push() adds a new element to the array.

            JSON means JavaScript Object Notation, the reason why it has JavaScript in it's name is because it is a valid JS code; its a simple format that allows you to store and transfer nested or hierarchal data; it's so popular that other languages has libraries capable to parse and write JSON like Python JSON library. Internet GET and POST request usually run data through JSON format.Json allows to encapsulate objects inside other objects. It's easy to bring bug inside JSON files when written by hand that's why it's recommendable to use <a href = "http://www.jsonlint.com" class = "links">JSON Lint</a> to verify sintax errors.
            <br>
            JSON serves the same purpose as XML and that is to exchange codes in readable way between humans and computers in a constant format. It can contain dictionaries, objects, lists, booleans, null, floats, numbers, strings...etc.
            <br>
            Let's see an example of who JSON looks:
            <br>
            <span class="code">
              1- >>> import json 
              <br>

            then in the second line we have a variable named j that has inside a string that contains a dictionary with two keys "one" and "numbers"; the value of one is an integer, the value of numbers is a list with integers and a float
            <br>
            in the 3rd line we call a function named load string "loads"
            <br>
            4th line loads a python dictionary with our keys and values, Python dictionaries doesn't return values in the same order that JSON has them.
            <br>
            5th lines saved json.loads(j) in a new variable named d
            <br>
            6th line calls d with the value of the dictionary numbers
            <br>
            the line 7 gets us the dictionary inside key "numbers"
            <br> 
            we call d with key "one" in line 8
            <br>
            the last line, 9th shows us the value of key "one", 1

            Meaning Application Interface. They help humans to communicate with machines; intead of using simple html's we use JSON and XML to communicate with computers. Here is an example on how computers communicate with humans and viceversa:
            <img src="images/api.png" alt="api example">
            <br>
            This image explains how is the communication between servers.
            The user makes a request to the website hipmunk, then the hipmunk servers request information to airlines servers, Amtrak servers, hotels serves, etc.then these airlines, amtrak, hoteles services send the response to the servers of hipmunk. Finally hipmunk sends the information to the user in form of HTML.
            <br>
            HTML is not an ideal communication language between computers because its prone error in tags. XML requieres to have an opening and a closing tag which HTML sometimes doesn´t. Let's see an image of a wall of codes prone to errors because it's in HTML.

            The correct way of doing this is by using an API like XML.This in an example of XML:

            In the course we used urllib and urllib2, so what's the difference between these two?:
            <br>
            Well the first thing to understand is that they are not alternatives to each other. Both are Python modues that handle URL requests, but let's see the differences:

            <br>
          <q>
            <i>urllib2 can accept a Request object to set the headers for a URL request, urllib accepts only a URL. That means, you cannot masquerade your User Agent string etc.
            urllib provides the urlencode method which is used for the generation of GET query strings, urllib2 doesn't have such a function. This is one of the reasons why urllib is often used along with urllib2.</i>

            To access the url we need to import the "urllib's" modules.

              Good User-Agent.- A good way to start being a good user agent is by choosing good headers that describe which browser you're using to access a website. When using urllib2 you can especify your headers in the request and you should establish a user-agent who says who you are, your name, links to your website so whoever is on the other side locate you easily and block you if you're using the web in a bad way.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rate Limit Yourself.- Be reasonable on how you update your notifications in places like twitter for example, you can create an infinite loop that gives you twitter notifications every millisecond but of course you are going to damage twitter services, so what is going to happen is that twitter is going to ban you. So always limit yourself on how you request notifications.

            After finishing this NanoDegree I realized that I have learned a lot about how to think as a programmer, the importance of avoiding repetition, classes, objects, dictionaries, for loop and while loops, inheritances, templates, lists, among other terms. I learn basic skills on three different languages that are HTML, CSS and Python. I definitely want to keep going. I'm not going to lie, sometimes I felt really frustrated because there were things that I couldn't understand but in the end is gratifying to know that even when it's a basic level NanoDegree I never quit and I kept going forward. I enjoyed so much this course and the main reason why I started this IPND its because I want to be an Android app developer, but I needed some code background to start doing that, that's why IPND looked like the best option to get started with.
            <br>
            <br>
            I did some research on the next course I want to start, the Android Developer for begginers. I started with the free course material to see how it looks and I realized that now I can understand a lot of thing they are talking about like XML or the simple fact that they use opening and closing tags to. The way that you edit the TextView or ImageView looks like a mix between a Python Dictionary but with HTML tags, so basically it's an XML file. I found that tech terms doesn't scare me that much that when I stated IPND.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started the very first lesson of Android Developer for begginers and this is what I learned so far:
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's start with the "Views". When they mentioned something called Views and how they are "contructed", the very first thing that came to my mind was a website structure, I remember the first lessons in the IPND that they said that everything in a webpage is a box, everything is divided by boxes. So that's how Views are, they are divided in TextView, ImageView and Buttons boxes.
            Let's see the definition of these three:
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>A View is a rectangular area visible on the screen. It has a width and height, and sometimes a background color.
            The illustration shows Views of three different types. An ImageView displays an image such as an icon or photo. A TextView displays text. A Button is a TextView that is sensitive to touch: tap it with your finger and it will respond. And a ViewGroup is a big View—often invisible—that contains and positions the smaller Views inside of it. A View on the screen is drawn by a Java object inside the Android device. In fact, the Java object is the real View. But when talking about what the user sees, it’s convenient to refer to the rectangular area on the screen as the “View”</i>
            <br>
            <br>
            The first thing I learned in this ND was to use the User Interface. The code of the views is written in XML and in CamelCase. Here's the sintax of XML TextView and ImageView:
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class = "code">
              &lt;TextView<br>
              android:text="Sample Text"<br>
              android:textColor="#E0F7FA"<br>
              android:background="#80CBC4"<br>
              android:layout_width="wrap_content"<br>
              android:layout_height="wrap_content"<br>
              android:textAppearance="?android:textAppearanceLarge"<br>
              android:textAllCaps="false"<br>
              android:textStyle="italic"/&gt;
              <br>
              <br>
              &lt;ImageView<br>
              android:src="@drawable/cake"<br>
              android:layout_width="wrap_content"<br>
              android:layout_height="wrap_content"<br>
              android:scaleType="centerCrop"/&gt;
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            Attributes are the items inside the tags. For example, "wrap_content" means that it doesn't matter how big the text or image is, the height and width layout is going to adjust to that image/text. There are another definitions like dp that means Density independent Pixels and these are hundreds of thousands pixels, basically what screens are made of. The better the screen the more of dp's it will have in the same amount of space; the number of pixels in a fixed space is known as the screen's pixel density. Another term we saw in this first lesson was sp, scale independent pixels and they're just used in fonts.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now let's analize the sintax of the xml above. On the first part we have  a TextView that is conformed by text, color, background, width and height attributes; if we look closely to the attribute textColor we can see that it's value is an hex color, the background has an hex color too, all the values are inside quotes just like strings. We also find booleans here, take a look to android:textAllCaps="false", the value is false but if we switch that value for true, then all the text is going to be uppercase. In the ImageView case we have an interesting attribute named android:scaleType="centerCrop" and this attribute it's going to adjust the center of the image and fit it into the screen so you can see the complete image instead of just a portion of it; it also gives this look of no border image, that is called full bleed image. We also learn that there are some default font sizes in android dev, you only need to apply the codes below to switch between small, medium and large.
            <br>
            <br>
          <span class = "code">
            android:textAppearance="?android:textAppearanceSmall"<br>
            android:textAppearance=“?android:textAppearanceMedium"<br>
            android:textAppearance="?android:textAppearanceLarge"
          </span>
          <br>
          <br>
